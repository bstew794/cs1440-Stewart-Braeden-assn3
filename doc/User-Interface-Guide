Hello,
I am mr.DNA and I am here to help guide you through the Bingo game interface. the console will display a menu labeled
"Main" along with two options, "C" and "X". Pressing "X" on your keyboard will exit the Bingo game interface whilst
pressing "C" will create a new Bingo deck of cards. You will then be prompted to enter the card size, maximum number on
the cards, and number of cards in your deck and a new menu called "Deck" will be displayed to interact with your deck.
These options include: "Print a card to the screen", "Display the whole deck to the screen", and "Save the whole deck to
a file"; they are activated by pressing "P, D, or S", respectively. Also keep in mind that you must provide the id of
the card you want to print if you press "P", or the output file name if you press "S" on your keyboard.
You may press "X" at any these menus to exit the application.

End of Line...
