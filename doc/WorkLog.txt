I got NumberSet.py to pass its unit tests. However, I had to add a new variable called "currIndex" which I will add to my
UML later, and I am unsure about how it all works still but I will be committing this version today. Later that day, I
got Deck.py and Card.py to pass their unit tests; no new variables were added but I am still not finished with Card.py
and Deck.py to make them fully functional for the generator. My next objective will be to finish those and the user
interface.
