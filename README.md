## Overview

For my next project at DuckieCorp, I was tasked with writing an interactive
Bingo card generator. This project had been started by our C++ team, but
partway through the customer and the project manager decided that Python would
be a better platform for this system.  The partially-completed C++ program was
translated into Python before the project was assigned to me.

This is a complete programming product consisting of

*   A program which is extensible (can be easily modified)
*   Documentation (both technical and user-oriented)
*   Unit test cases

Before using this product, make sure to read through the User Interface Guide, Bingo UML, and Instructions for part 3.0
for a clear understanding of the code. I also advise running the unit tests if you can't figure out why the code is not
working for certain functions.
